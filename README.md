#+TITLE: Stream Temperature Project

# Stream Temperature Project

This repository contains code used for data retrieval, munging, and and analysis for exploring how stream temperatures are and are not changing across North America.

Tasks | Responsible | Due Date (aspirational) | Notes
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
data source lit review | all | **rolling**  |
Seasonal Mann-Kendall & Sen's Slope: daily data  | AT | **5/25** |
re-pull in Daymet data | WS | **5/25** |
pull in GRIDMET data | WS | **5/25** |
re-create (daily) air-wtr ratio plots with new sites (explore variance by year, month) | WS | **6/24** |
re-create (annual) MAT-MWT ratio plots with new sites | WS | **5/25** |
model air-wtr curves for sites using linear, power-law, etc., compare efficacy | WS | **6/24** |
if above interesting, see if 'curve-type' maps onto watershed hydrogeological or climatic characteristics | | **6/24** |
look at regions of coupling and decoupling (in space and time) -- map onto watershed hydrogeological or climatic characteristics | | **6/24** |
are streams getting warmer? annual and daily SMK for stream temp (repeat with air for comparison) | |  |
re-run Mean Annual analysis, but with Mean Annual Spring/Fall/Winter/Summer Mean/Max/Min (?)|  |  |
contour plots and analysis | |  |
~~explore  MacroSheds data and see if any good stuff~~ | WS | **5/25** | checked it out, very few sites with temp and Q in MS dataset. but, still might be worth getting HBEF and friends
~~clean up GH and add commentary~~ | WS | **5/11** |
~~Mann-Kendall & Sen's Slope: annual data~~  | WS | **done** | csv's on Gdrive

strike through when complete!
